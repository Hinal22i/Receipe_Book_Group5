        <p class=" leading-7 px-8">Suya, just the name is mouthwatering! This particular kabob has always been my favorite. It is reminiscent of my childhood in Nigeria: walking at nighttime, inhaling all the smoke and wonderful aroma of beef suya that would fill the air.Suya is a delicious, spicy Nigerian grilled Meat delicacy. It’s like shish kebab, but with a spicy kick! It is made with thinly sliced skewered beef.   <br> <br> So much has changed since then, but I try to keep up with the tradition and make suya here in America for my family and friends every chance I get. I now make them in the oven or air fryer. Suya is traditionally cooked over an open flame on skewers, but you can also cook it in your oven if you don’t have access to an outdoor grill or don’t want to use one.It will be very delicious but without the smoky taste.</p>
